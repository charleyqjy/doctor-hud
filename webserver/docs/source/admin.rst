Admin Operation
===============

The admin position is relatively simple, but it still is the gateway for allowing users to actually login and gain access to specific hospital rooms. The admin can issue the immediate temporary tokens to user, as well as setup existing users with calendar slots for specific rooms.

Getting to Admin Page
---------------------
The admin must login with their credentials first, then navigate to the admin page. They will have a button in the banner that will redirect them.

Click the generate token button on the left side.

The token number can be distributed, and it will last for up to five minutes. After that the token expires, and a new one will have to be generated. Tokens can only be used once.


Adding User to Calendar Slot
----------------------------
Select the user in the bottom right of the window and alter the access begin and end times to adjust for when a user can gain access.

Multiple users can access the same room at the same time, provided that they are recorded in the access table.
