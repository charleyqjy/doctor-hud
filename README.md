# DoctorHUD Beta Release Instructions
DoctorHUD delivers patient sensor data to remote doctors securely over the web in telemedicine sessions. Read this [tutorial](https://jlipworth.github.io/doctor-hud/help/html/masterdoc.html#)   for a detailed walk through of the entire system. 

## Client Side Quick Start
Google Chrome is recommended for our client interface.
### Connection
Goto https://jlipworth.github.io/doctor-hud/ and select a existing server to connect to. 

If you want to try out a running server with TLS secure communication. Select the "online test server" option.  
If you're running and testing on your own local server, select "Local Test Server" option.  
The "Fake Hospital" options are left as placeholders for real hospital servers, which doesn't have any real usage yet.

### Log in 
Test guest account:   **username=test, password=test**, which has been granted infinite access permission to connect to the online test server. Click log in and feel free to play around.
